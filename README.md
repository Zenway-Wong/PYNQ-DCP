# Haze Removal of video stream with PYNQ

This is a vision design for [2021 Xilinx summer school](https://github.com/xupsh/2021_summercamp_project), to implement and accelerate [haze removal](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/archive/2009/dehaze_cvpr2009.pdf) algorithm based on PYNQ platform. It includes the details from software algorithm to hardware acceleration.

## Requirements

* Board: PYNQ-Z2
* PYNQ Image: PYNQ v2.6
* Install [composable overlay](https://github.com/Xilinx/PYNQ_Composable_Pipeline)

## Usage

Browse the ipython notebooks in Jupyter Lab after clone. 

Then copy the folder containing composable overlay bitstream into this repo.

## Notebook decriptions

* 00: some bugs (ignore it)
* 01: introduce and improve the DCP haze removal algorithm
* 02: process video stream with base overlay, using previous algorithm and interactive feature of ipthon 
* 03: replace base overlay with composable overlay
* 04: accelerate haze removal with IP core generated by HLS
